Model X is direct replacement controller for the old and good IBM Model M keyboards.
Old mechanic keyboards are coming back among enthusiasts and programmers. And they're gaining value.
Unfortunatly modern computers do not have DIN or PS2 ports anymore, so there's no simple way to connect a 40 years old hardware to our brand new Laptop.
By simply replacing the entire legacy electronics inside the keyboard, it is possible to revive a "piece of history" and even add modern function like USB connection, Wireless and remappable caracters. Old PCB can be saved for reverting to orginal condition.
The Model X CTRL is designed to fit and be used with standard 102/103 keys, 84/85 keys IBM SSK (Space Saving Keyboard) and, with an adapter, 122 key IBM M122 (AKA Battlecruiser).

Main features:
  - Easy Plug and Play upgrade- no need to solder anything to original PCB or Cable
  - BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and USB type C Connection
  - Battery recharge via USB-C (same cable as most of the smart phones, notebooks and laptops)
  - Low consumption: a 2000 mAh battery last for over one month without recharging or turning off
  - Connectors accepts original keyboard Flat Flex Cable
  - Tested with IBM Model M 139140X and IBM Model M122 Type2/3 (AKA Battleship)
  - ZMK firmware (open source)
  - Expandable: 2 User IOs can be used to add functions to the keyboard
  - Based on ProMicro NRF52840 dev board (aka SuperMini) - technically the Model X is a "shield"
  - PCB designed in KiCad (open source)

As a completion of the Model X, there are some accessories:
  - Model X EXT122
